# Python-Numpy-Programming
The [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language becomes a powerful enviroment for scientific computing because it is supported by many popular libraries such as [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and almost Deep Learning frameworks [Keras](https://keras.io/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/),...,etc. Let's learn a bit about how to work with Python before go further into Machine Learning / Deep Learning.
